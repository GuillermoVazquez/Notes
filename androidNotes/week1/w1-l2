possible project idea:
	- friends-only uber
		- car sharing
	- class-chat
	- spotify matching
		-shows people in certain radius that listen to same music


###spotify match-making###
	- We will be creating an app that allows the user to interact with and get information on other accounts that have a similar taste in music in a close proximity. The app will work with the Spotify app 
		and gps ( gps sensor )  to create an in-depth platform that gives the user the opportunity to connect with other users. The back-end functionality would be responsible for mathcing accounts
		based on gps information and Spotify account info obtained from the Spofity api.
