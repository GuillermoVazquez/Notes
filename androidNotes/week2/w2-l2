System Services:

	you receive a handle to a service through a call to Context.getSystemService(service)

	
App Widgets

	mini applications that run inside another app
	
	can update themselves automatically
	
	new - > widget - > appWidget

	auto update limited tp 30 mins

	your widget can be added multiple times

	once widget is pasted to a screen know that onUpdate() is fired 

		so manipulate the widget in updateAppWidget()

	only a subset of views can be used for a widget

		RemoteView objects lets you manipulate these views

	AppWidgetProvider is a BroadcastReceiver

		in the manifest there is a receiver for the widget  that solely looks for appwidgetupdates

			so programmatically manualy update the widget make intent, make AppWidgetManager, get ids, broadcast  

				ex./  Intent intent = new Intent();
				      AppWidgetManager awm = (AppWidgetManager) getSystemService(SystemService);
				      int[] appWidgetIds = awm.getAppWidgetIds(new ComponentName(MainActivity.this));
				      intent.putExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_IDS,appWidgetIds);
				      -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
				      sendBroadcast(intent);

	to automatically programmatically update the widget use a PendingIntet

		ex./
			PendingIntent pi = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(MainActivity.this,);
			AlarmManager am = (AlarmManager) getSystemService(ALARM_SERVICE);
			am.setRepeating(AlarmManager.rtc);


Broadcast

	systemwide anouncement delivered as an intent

	originates from system or app

Broadcast Receiver

	all run in undefined order

	responds to a broadcast

	should do little work

	can be created in another component ( affected by parent component lifecycle )

	can receive a broadcast from any application, use permissions to control who is able to send broadcasts to the particular receiver

	register:

		<receiver ... </receiver>

	child of <application>

	can contain <intent-filter>

Local Broadcast

	resides only in application

	LocalBroadCastManager class

	very efficient

receivers only valid for the execution of onReceive()

to not receive any broadcasts from any application set android:exported="false"
