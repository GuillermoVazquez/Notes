Accessing a provider
	
	query the user dictionary 

	mcurser = getContentResolver().query(
	uri,columnstoreturnforeachrow,selectionclause,selectionArgs,SortOrder);
		getContentResolver is the object you call on to query data

		it returns a curser object that is a pointer to data set 
				
				starts at [-1]

		you then call things on this cursor to get or set things

	you must get permission for content provider in manifest
