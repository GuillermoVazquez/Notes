Location Services with Mapping 


Mapping data may require third-party service

	-heavy stuff so deff

Google Maps

	Common classes:

	Latlng

		object to store coordinate info

	MarkerOptions

		places a marker on the map

	CameraUpdate/CameraUpdateFactory

		controls the current view of the map

	

	What you need:

		Google Account

			API Key

			Used to grant monitor access

		Google Play Services (Maps)

	Dont go straigt to third-party service provider

		dont allow your application users to access the service provider/ you cant control their behavior

			some jag sends 3 thousand requests in an hour

		always provide application service Provider server between user and thrid party servers

	
Google Maps Steps:

	- go to Google API console

	- GET KEY

	- Create a new project

	- copy and paste key into your android project manifest as      meta-data

		android name = geo.api_key

	main:

		MapView
		GoogleMap
		LocationManager
		LocationListener

		onCreate()
		mapview.onCreate(savedInstance)
		onDestroy()
		mapview.onDestroy()
		...

			mapview is needy with regard to info consumption and state changes

				do the above to keep it updated!!!

		implement onMapReady(Google googleMap)
			this.googleMap = googleMap
		

		mapView.getMapAsync(this)

		locationListener = new ... {

			onLocationChanged(Location location)
				LatLng latlng = new LatLng (location.getLat(), location.getLong)
				CameraUpdate cu = CameraUpdateFactory.newLatLng(latlng)
				googleMap.animateCamera(cu)
