Bluetooth

Android provides APIs to:

	scan for other bluetooth devices

	query for paired bluetooth devices

	establish RFCOMM channels

	Connect to other devices through service discovery

Permissions

	android.permission.BLUETOOTH (data exchange of devices)

	android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN (discover and establish connections)

Bluetooth can also be used to determine a location

	through connections to personal devices or beacons  

to cope with that

	you must also request for FINE or COURSE location permission

Android Bluetooth profiles

	headset
	a2dp (advanced audio distribution profile)
	heatlthdevices

	

code implementation (find devices):

BluetoothAdapter blue;

oncreate

	ArrayList<BluetoothDevices> devices;
	
	blue = BluetoothAdapater.getDefaultAdapter(); //check if available

		else startActivityForResult(new INtent(BluetoothAdapter.Action_Request_enable,123)

	devices = new ArrayList<>(blue.getBondedDevices())
	
code implementation (r/w to devices): look online
